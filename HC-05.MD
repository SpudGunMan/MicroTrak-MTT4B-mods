## Enable PORTA Configuration to BT-Module
To change any settings on the BT [module](doc/HC05BT.pdf) (using the 2.5mm cable) change the jumpers to the following, you will likley need to source 1 "pc"-jumper for this task as not all shipped have 3 jumpers installed.

- ***NOTE*** I have experienced failures of the MAX232 Chip and recommend having spares for this hardware its on a DIP socket for a reason. Be cautious to use ESD protection and make sure power is not connected when modifying these jumpers.

Set up a terminal-emulator at 19200 on your PC, With MTT4BT power off, remove the J7 jumper shunt, power the MTT4BT, then place the J7 jumper shunt on the J7 header pins. 

In the terminal-emulator console enter `​AT` and press enter, and the module should respond with `O​K` ​If it does not, check that the terminal is sending CR/LF when enter is pressed. It may be possible that the baud rate is 38400 or 9600, or 4800 so also try those if you don't connect.

You can copy and paste the following, full block to "reset" your module to Byonics default config. Paste into your terminal-emulator. if you really mess up `AT+ORGL` will reset to 38400 baud and then past the following..

```
AT+NAME=MTT4BT
AT+PSWD=1234
AT+ADDR?
AT+UART:19200,1,0
```
additionally you can send from linux CLI
```
echo -e "AT+UART:19200,1,0\r" | picocom -b 38400 -qrx 1000 /dev/ttyUSB0
```
now, return to normal mode, remove J7 jumper shunt reset to the shown [BT-PORTA](https://github.com/SpudGunMan/MicroTrak-MTT4B-mods#port-a-bluetooth) mode after configuring. And [connect](#connecting-bluetooth)!
